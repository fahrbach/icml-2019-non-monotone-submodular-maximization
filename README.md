# Non-monotone Submodular Maximization with Nearly Optimal Adaptivity and Query Complexity

This repository contains the source code for the experiments in
[Non-monotone Submodular Maximization with
Nearly Optimal Adaptivity and Query Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06932)
(ICML 2019).

## Summary

We compare the low-adaptivity algorithm for non-monotone submodular maximization
in this paper with several benchmarks and demonstrate that it consistently finds
competitive solutions using significantly fewer rounds and queries.
Our experiments build on those in
([Balkanski et al., NeurIPS 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11462))
and explore applications of constrained submodular maximization for
image summarization, movie recommendation, and revenue maximization.
